## Getting Started with the NHT Archive Project

The NHT Archive Project serves Now Here This by developing custom wordpress. The project is broken into three sections: the theme, the core plugin, and the player plugin.

## Features

### The Theme (nht-theme)
* Basic Semantic HTML5 Markup
* W3C Valid Code Foundations
* Responsive Ready, ViewPort meta data
* HTML Class support for IE7, IE8, IE9 Conditionals (HTML5 Boilerplate)
* Clean, neatly organised code, with PHP annotations

### The Core Plugin (nht-plugin)
* Currently just boilerplate
* Plugin functionality needs to be refactored out of nht-theme directory

### The Player Plugin (nht-player)
* !! Causes namespace issues with styles from theme !!
* Currently just boilerplate
* Plugin functionality needs to be refactored out of nht-theme directory

### Future plans
* Support analytics (listen time, views, etc)
* Sharing support within the player
* Heavy shema.org support 
* Gutenberg support
