## Getting Started with the NHT Archive Project

The NHT Archive Project serves Now Here This by developing custom wordpress. The project is broken into three sections: the theme, the core plugin, and the player plugin.

## Features

### The Theme (nht-theme)
* Post types (Issues, Stories, Staff)
* Page templates (Staff page, Collection)

### The Core Plugin (nht-plugin)
* Currently only scaffolded
* Plugin functionality needs to be refactored out of nht-theme directory

### The Player Plugin (nht-player)
* Currently only scaffolded
* Plugin functionality needs to be refactored out of nht-theme directory

### Future plans
* Support analytics (listen time, views, etc)
* Sharing support within the player
* Heavy shema.org support 
* Gutenberg support
